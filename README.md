# flask_bbs
## introduction
This is a forum system developed based on flask. It is derived from a final class task, which implements modules such as login, register, publish posts, browse posts, modify personal information, and modify email. The rest of the modules will continue to be in-depth in the following study, and friends are welcome to pay more attention and make suggestions.
